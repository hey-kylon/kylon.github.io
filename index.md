### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs as it served as my introduction to Computer Science. 
    Having no prior experience with computer science it was a struggle initially. 
    But with hard word and folliwing instructions I was able to complete my first lab.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was fun for me as I used to live in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
    So I was very familiar with gambling and things of the nature. 
    I was able to write functions for the first time that led to blackjack being properly played.
 
* Lab 7

    Lab 10,was fun as it was our one and only solo lab. 
    I have always liked working alone all throughout school.
    SO being able to do a solo lab was very fun, and I enjoyed the process.
